# Lumi

**Abandon hope all ye who enter here.**

Lumi is a shell for Windows, written in C# because command prompt sucks and PowerShell ~~is even worse~~ leaves much to be desired. Anyone is free to use, abuse, toy with, tear apart, or set fire to this project as they please.
However, **this is a personal project intended solely for my own use**. Do not expect quality, support for anything but Windows and the full .NET Framework (no Mono, no .NET Core), or documentation. The code may be ugly, janky, and confusing; there will most definitely be bugs.

This project is only a few days old as of the first commit. Things are incomplete, there are "temporary" hacks all over the place, many things are yet to be added, and things are likely to be removed or changed unexpectedly.

You have been warned.
